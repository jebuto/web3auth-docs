This guide will cover the basics of how to set up your Web3Auth SDK and Auth0 account for the integration and provide you with the links on how to
develop a basic web application on the blockchain of your choice.

**[Live Demo](https://w3a.link/auth0-react-example)**

## Quick Start

```bash
npx degit Web3Auth/web3auth-pnp-examples/web-no-modal-sdk/custom-authentication/single-verifier-examples/auth0-no-modal-example w3a-auth0-demo && cd w3a-auth0-demo && npm install && npm run start
```

## How it works?

<Tabs
defaultValue="spa"
values={[
  { label: "Single Page Applications (SPA) Flow", value: "spa" },
  { label: "Regular Web Applications (RWA) Flow", value: "rwa" },
]}
>
<TabItem value="spa">

When integrating Web3Auth with Auth0 SPA the flow looks something like this:

![Auth0 SPA Flow](/content-hub/guides/auth0/auth0-spa-flow.png)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="rwa">

When integrating Web3Auth with Auth0 RWA, we need an additional backend server to communicate with Auth0. The flow looks something like this:

![Auth0 RWA Flow](/content-hub/guides/auth0/auth0-rwa-flow.png)

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

- When a user logs in with Auth0, Auth0 sends a JWT `id_token` to the app. This JWT token is sent to the Web3Auth SDK's login function.

- Finally, on successful validation of the JWT token, Web3Auth SDK will generate a private key for the user, in a self-custodial way, resulting in
  easy onboarding for your user to the application.

## Using the Web3Auth SDK

To use the Web3Auth SDK, you need to add the dependency of the respective platform SDK of Web3Auth to your project. To know more about the available
SDKs, please have a look at this [documentation page](/sdk).

For this guide, we will be talking through the [Web3Auth Plug and Play No Modal SDK](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal) and using the
[OpenLogin Provider](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/openlogin) alongside it to enable Custom Authentication through Auth0.

### Installation

<Installation />

### Initialization

<InitializationIntro />

For this guide, we're only focusing on the Instantiation, Configuration for the Openlogin Adapter (the default adapter that enables social logins) and
Initialization of the Web3Auth SDK. To know more about the other things you can do with Web3Auth, check out our
[SDK Reference](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal).

#### Instantiating Web3Auth

<InstantiationWeb3Auth />

#### Initializing the Openlogin Adapter

<OpenloginConfigCode />

Here, you need to pass over your Web3Auth `clientId` in the adapterSettings object and your Custom Auth `verifierName` and Auth0 `clientId` in the
`loginConfig` object. This makes sure that the Openlogin Adapter can connect to the correct verifier and Auth0 server.

<InitializationWeb3Auth />

### Login

Once initialized, you can use the `connectTo()` function to authenticate the user when they click the login button.

<Tabs
defaultValue="social"
values={[
  { label: "Social Logins", value: "social" },
  { label: "SMS Passwordless Login", value: "sms" },
  { label: "Email Passwordless Login", value: "email" },
]}
>
<TabItem value="social">

```tsx
import { WALLET_ADAPTERS, CHAIN_NAMESPACES } from "@web3auth/base";

await web3auth.connectTo(WALLET_ADAPTERS.OPENLOGIN, {
  loginProvider: "jwt",
  extraLoginOptions: {
    domain: "https://web3auth.au.auth0.com", // Please append "https://" before your domain
    verifierIdField: "sub", // For SMS & Email Passwordless, use "name" as verifierIdField
  },
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sms">

```tsx
import { WALLET_ADAPTERS, CHAIN_NAMESPACES } from "@web3auth/base";

await web3auth.connectTo(WALLET_ADAPTERS.OPENLOGIN, {
  loginProvider: "jwt",
  extraLoginOptions: {
    domain: "https://web3auth.au.auth0.com", // Please append "https://" before your domain
    verifierIdField: "name",
  },
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="email">

```tsx
import { WALLET_ADAPTERS, CHAIN_NAMESPACES } from "@web3auth/base";

await web3auth.connectTo(WALLET_ADAPTERS.OPENLOGIN, {
  loginProvider: "jwt",
  extraLoginOptions: {
    domain: "https://web3auth.au.auth0.com", // Please append "https://" before your domain
    verifierIdField: "name",
  },
});
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

When connecting, your `connectTo` function takes the arguments for the adapter you want to connect to and the options for the login. The major thing
to note here is the `domain` option in the `extraLoginOptions` object. This is the domain of your Auth0 tenant so that you can be redirected to login
there directly from the Web3Auth Plug and Play No Modal SDK.

### Get the User Profile

```tsx
const user = await web3auth.getUserInfo();
console.log("User info", user);
```

Using the `getUserInfo` function, you can get the details of the logged-in user. Please note that these details are not stored anywhere in Web3Auth
network, but are fetched from the id_token you received from Auth0 and live in the frontend context.

### Logout

```tsx
await web3auth.logout();
```

Logging out your user is as simple as calling the `logout` function.

### Difference between SPA and RWA

In the SPA flow, the frontend gets the JWT `id_token` from Auth0 directly. This flow is leveraged by the Web3Auth SDK, which handles all the callbacks
by itself and the user just needs to set up the `OpenloginAdapter` and connect to the Web3Auth SDK, adding in the Auth0 `client_id` in it. Hence, this
is the implicit flow and is the most suitable flow for setting up your authentication via Auth0 and Web3Auth.

In the RWA flow, you have to spin up a server on your own where you'll receive the authorization code from Auth0. Web3Auth still requires an
`id_token` to be sent to the OpenloginAdapter to log the user in the frontend context. This is where you need to make another call from the backend
server to Auth0 to get the `id_token` and pass it over to your frontend where you can send it to the Web3Auth SDK.

### Setting up your application with RWA Flow

- In addition to the steps above, set up your Auth0 RWA on the dashboard and add callback URLs for both your backend and frontend
- On the frontend, your login button should hit on the following URL

```url
https://{YOUR_DOMAIN_URL}/authorize?scope=openid&response_type=code&client_id={YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri={YOUR_BACKEND_SERVER_WHICH_WILL_GET_JWT_TOKEN_FROM_AUTH0}&state=STATE
```

- This is where the user is redirected to a login screen by Auth0.
- On successful login, the user will be redirected to your backend server with authorization `code` as a query parameter.
- In the backend server, you can use the `code` to get the `id_token` from Auth0 and redirect the user to the frontend with `id_token` as a query
  parameter

```tsx
app.get('/callback', (req, res) => {
  var options = {
    method: 'POST',
    url: 'https://{YOUR_DOMAIN_URL}/oauth/token',
    headers: { 'content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' },
    form:{
      grant_type: 'authorization_code',
      client_id: 'AUTH0_CLIENT_ID',
      client_secret: 'AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET',
      code: req.query.code, // the authorization code you got from auth0
      redirect_uri: 'https://{YOUR_FRONTEND_URL}',
      scope: "openid profile email"
    }
   };

   var id_token = "";

   request(options, function (error, response, data) {
    id_token = JSON.parse(data)["id_token"];
    redirect_url = "http://{YOUR_FRONTEND_URL}?token=%22+id_token;
    // Redirection URL to frontend with `id_token` as a query parameter
    res.redirect(redirect_url);
  });
})
```

- In the frontend, pass on this `id_token` to the Web3Auth SDK to authenticate the user

```tsx
await web3auth.connectTo(WALLET_ADAPTERS.OPENLOGIN, {
  loginProvider: "jwt",
  extraLoginOptions: {
    id_token: "YOUR_ID_TOKEN_FETCHED_FROM_BACKEND_SERVER",
    verifierIdField: "sub",
  },
});
```
