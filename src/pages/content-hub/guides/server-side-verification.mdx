This guide will cover the basics of how to use Web3Auth's Server Side Verification to verify the `idToken` received in the `web3auth.getUserInfo()`
method of Web3Auth.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx degit Web3Auth/web3auth-pnp-examples/web-no-modal-sdk/server-side-verification-no-modal-example w3a-ssv-demo && cd w3a-ssv-demo && npm install && npm run dev
```

## Prerequisites

<Web3AuthPrerequisites />

- A [Google Developer](https://console.developers.google.com) account to be used as Login provider for Web3Auth Custom Authentication.

## Setup

### Setup your Google App

<GoogleAppSetup />

### Setup your Web3Auth Dashboard

<SetupWeb3AuthDashboard />

<CreatingVerifiers />

### Setup your Next.js Project

<SetupNextjsProject />

## Using the Web3Auth SDK

To use the Web3Auth SDK, you need to add the dependency of the respective platform SDK of Web3Auth to your project. To know more about the available
SDKs, please have a look at this [documentation page](/sdk).

For this guide, we will be talking through the [Web3Auth Plug and Play No Modal SDK](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal) and using the
[OpenLogin Provider](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/openlogin) alongside it to enable Custom Authentication through Google Login.

### Installation

<Installation />

### Initialization

<InitializationIntro />

For this guide, we're only focusing on the Instantiation, Configuration for the Openlogin Adapter (the default adapter that enables social logins) and
Initialization of the Web3Auth SDK. To know more about the other things you can do with Web3Auth, check out our
[SDK Reference](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal).

#### Instantiating Web3Auth

<InstantiationWeb3Auth />

#### Initializing the Openlogin Adapter

<OpenloginConfigCodeGoogle />

Here, you need to pass over your Web3Auth `clientId` in the adapterSettings object and your Custom Auth `verifierName` and AWS Cognito `clientId` in
the loginConfig object. This makes sure that the Openlogin Adapter can connect to the correct verifier and AWS Cognito server.

<InitializationWeb3Auth />

### Authentication

#### Logging in

Once initialized, you can use the `connectTo()` function to authenticate the user when they click the login button.

```tsx
import { WALLET_ADAPTERS, CHAIN_NAMESPACES } from "@web3auth/base";

await web3auth.connectTo(WALLET_ADAPTERS.OPENLOGIN, {
  loginProvider: "google",
});
```

When connecting, your `connectTo` function takes the arguments for the adapter you want to connect to and the `loginProvider` for the login.

### Get the User Profile

```tsx
const user = await web3auth.getUserInfo();
console.log("User info", user);
```

Using the `getUserInfo` function, you can get the details of the logged in user. Please note that these details are not stored anywhere in Web3Auth
network, but are fetched from the id_token you received from AWS Cognito and live in the frontend context.

### Logout

```tsx
await web3auth.logout();
```

Logging out your user is as simple as calling the `logout` function.
