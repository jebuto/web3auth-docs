This guide will cover the basics of how to set up your Web3Auth SDK and Twitch Login for custom authentication and provide you the steps on how to
develop a basic web application on the Ethereum blockchain.

**Live Demo:** https://web3auth-core-twitch-demo.vercel.app

## Quick Start

```bash
npx degit Web3Auth/web3auth-pnp-examples/web-no-modal-sdk/custom-authentication/single-verifier-examples/twitch-no-modal-example w3a-twitch-demo && cd w3a-twitch-demo && npm install && npm run start
```

## How it works?

When integrating Web3Auth with Twitch Login the flow looks something like this:

![Web3Auth Core - Twitch Login Flow](/images/implicit-flow.svg)

- When a user logs in with `Twitch`, Twitch sends a JWT `id_token` to the app. This JWT token is sent to the Web3Auth SDK's login function.

- Finally, on successful validation of the JWT token, Web3Auth SDK will generate a private key for the user, in a self-custodial way, resulting in
  easy onboarding for your user to the application.

## Prerequisites

<Web3AuthPrerequisites />

- A [Twitch Developer](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps/create) account to be used as Login provider for Web3Auth Custom Authentication.

## Setup

### Setup your Twitch App

<SetupTwitch />

### Setup your Web3Auth Dashboard

<SetupWeb3AuthDashboard />

- Create a **Verifier** from the **Custom Authentication** tab of your Web3Auth project with the following configuration:

  - Choose a name of your choice for the verifier identifier. `eg. web3auth-twitch-demo`
  - Select environment: `sapphire_devnet`, or `sapphire_mainnet` as per your requirement.
  - Select `Twitch` from the **Login Provider**. ![Twitch - Login Providers list on Web3Auth Dashboard](/images/dashboard/create-verifier.png)
  - Paste the **Client ID** from the Twitch App(above) to the `Client ID` field.
    ![Twitch Client ID on Web3Auth Dashboard](/images/dashboard/create-verifier-twitch.png)
  - Click on the `Create` button to create your verifier. It may take up to 10 minutes to deploy the verifier. You'll receive an email once it's
    complete.

- You will require the `verifierName` of the newly created verifier and `clientId` of the Plug and Play Project.

## Using the Web3Auth SDK

To use the Web3Auth SDK, you need to add the dependency of the respective platform SDK of Web3Auth to your project. To know more about the available
SDKs, please have a look at this [documentation page](/sdk).

For this guide, we will be talking through the [Web3Auth Plug and Play No Modal SDK](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal) and using the
[OpenLogin Provider](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/openlogin) alongside it to enable Custom Authentication through Twitch Login.

### Installation

<Installation />

### Initialization

<InitializationIntro />

For this guide, we're only focusing on the Instantiation, Configuration for the Openlogin Adapter (the default adapter that enables social logins) and
Initialization of the Web3Auth SDK. To know more about the other things you can do with Web3Auth, checkout our [SDK Reference](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal).

#### Instantiating Web3Auth

<InstantiationWeb3Auth />

#### Initializing the Openlogin Adapter

<OpenloginConfigCodeTwitch />

Here, you need to pass over your Web3Auth `clientId` in the adapterSettings object and your Custom Auth `verifierName` and AWS Cognito `clientId` in
the loginConfig object. This makes sure that the Openlogin Adapter can connect to the correct verifier and AWS Cognito server.

<InitializationWeb3Auth />

### Authentication

#### Logging in

Once initialized, you can use the `connectTo()` function to authenticate the user when they click the login button.

```tsx
import { WALLET_ADAPTERS, CHAIN_NAMESPACES } from "@web3auth/base";

await web3auth.connectTo(WALLET_ADAPTERS.OPENLOGIN, {
  loginProvider: "twitch",
});
```

When connecting, your `connectTo` function takes the arguments for the adapter you want to connect to and the `loginProvider` for the login.

### Get the User Profile

```tsx
const user = await web3auth.getUserInfo();
console.log("User info", user);
```

Using the `getUserInfo` function, you can get the details of the logged in user. Please note that these details are not stored anywhere in Web3Auth
network, but are fetched from the id_token you received from AWS Cognito and lives in the frontend context.

### Logout

```tsx
await web3auth.logout();
```

Logging out your user is as simple as calling the `logout` function.

## Example code

The code for the application we developed in this guide can be found in the
[Web3Auth Core Twitch Login Example](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-pnp-examples/tree/main/web-no-modal-sdk/custom-authentication/single-verifier-examples/twitch-no-modal-example).
