title: Trigger Login using your Auth Provider
---

Before you fetch your provider from Web3Auth, you need to trigger a login using your Auth Provider. Your Auth Provider, on a successful authentication
will return an ID Token, which will be passed to Web3Auth.

In this example, we're using Firebase as the authentication service. Web3Auth supports any OAuth2.0 compliant authentication service, we have
documented a few of the most common ones [here](/auth-provider-setup/).
