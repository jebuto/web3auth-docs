- Create a Verifier from the **Custom Auth** Section of the [Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/) with the following configuration:

  - Pick a name of your choice for the verifier identifier. `eg. auth0-project`
  - Choose `Social Login Providers` and select `Auth0` from the **Login Provider** dropdown.
  - Next, Choose your Authentication Type from `eg. Google, Twitter, GitHub etc..` to be the Auth provider.
  - Paste the `Client ID` and `Auth0 Domain` from the Auth0 SPA you created in the above steps. This will be used to validate the JWT token issued by
    Auth0. And, select `Sub` or `Email` as the JWT Verifier ID.
  - Click on the `Create Verifier` button to create your verifier. It may take up to 10-20 minutes to deploy the verifier on _Sapphire Devnet_. You'll
    receive an email once it's complete.
