You will need to install the following dependencies in order to get started with the project. If you only want to add login without mfa flow to your
application you can skip installation of dependencies required for login with mfa.

#### Dependencies Required for login without mfa:-

##### `@web3auth/node-sdk`

This is our new node sdk which will help you to integrate login without mfa flow in your application.

```shell
npm install --save @web3auth/node-sdk
```

#### Dependencies Required only login with mfa:-

##### `@web3auth/no-modal`

This is the main **Core** package that contains the Web3Auth SDK.

```shell
npm install --save @web3auth/no-modal
```

##### `@web3auth/openlogin-adapter`

For using Custom Authentication, we need to use the **OpenLogin Adapter**, where we can initialize the authentication details.

```shell
npm install --save @web3auth/openlogin-adapter
```

##### `@web3auth/base`

Since we're using typescript, we need the **`@web3auth/base`** package to provide types of the different variables we'll be using throughout the app
building process. This reduces errors to a very large extent.

```shell
npm install --save @web3auth/base
```

#### Web3 Libraries to interact with the blockchain

##### `web3` / `ethers`

According to your preference, you can choose to install the `web3` or `ethers` libraries, to talk to the EVM compatible blockchains under the hood.
For Solana, `@solana/web3.js` is the recommended choice.

We'll be having code snippets from `web3` and `ethers` in the documentation, so you can choose the one that suits you the best.
