One of the most important use cases of Web3Auth is to integrate it within wallets. This is because Web3Auth itself is not a wallet, it is wallet
infrastructure that can be plugged into your own wallet. Web3Auth results in a standard cryptographic key provider specific to the user and
application. This key provider can be used to sign transactions, messages, or making any other wallet transaction.

## Using Web3Auth to build your Wallet

A wallet is basically a wrapper around the user's private key, helping them manage their account on a much better level. With Web3Auth, you can make
the UI flows according to your own needs and requirements, while not thinking about the key generation and management part. Web3Auth will take care of
that for you. You can even save additional private keys safely within your application with Web3Auth.

Using Web3Auth for your own wallet flows has the following advantages:

1. The wallet owns the whole experience, with minimal external branding. You can even surpass that (have **zero Web3Auth Branding**) if you use
   [Web3Auth Core Kit](/core-kit/introduction).
2. You're even able to use your own OAuth 2.0 / Single Sign-On or any other flow for validating your user. You just need to provide Web3Auth with a
   JWT `id_token` and it will handle the key generation for you.
3. You can create your wallet for any chain, depending on your needs. Web3Auth generates the private key that can be used for any chain.
4. You can even use Web3Auth to create an HDKey and generate multiple sub accounts for your users. This is useful for wallets that support multiple
   accounts.
5. You can choose a platform of your choice. Web3Auth SDKs are available for most mobile, web and gaming platforms.

Additionally, you can get Web3Auth to securely expose the private key of the user to your application's frontend. Using the private key, you can use
the blockchain of your choice to make the further transactions within your wallet flows. You can even store additional private key a user might have
safely within your database, by substracting the difference between the user's private key and the one generated by Web3Auth, making it a secure and
non custodial private key store as well.
