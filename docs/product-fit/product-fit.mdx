Deciding on the right product for your needs can often be a critical part of ensuring the success of your launch. If you're considering Web3Auth or
[Torus Wallet](https://app.tor.us) for your project, the following qualifying questions will help you understand which of our products best fits your
requirements.

Choosing the right Web3Auth product is key to a successful project launch. The following qualifying questions aim to guide you through the
decision-making process. They cater to diverse project requirements and explore various key considerations. By reflecting on these questions, you'll
be better equipped to make an informed decision that ensures your selected Web3Auth product aligns seamlessly with your needs, laying a solid
foundation for your project's success.

We've divided the questions into the following categories:

- [Basic Product Questions](#basic-product-questions)
- [UI/ UX Questions](#ui-ux-questions)
- [Infrastructure Questions](#infrastructure-questions)
- [SSS vs MPC Questions](#sss-vs-mpc-questions)

## Basic Product Questions

### What are you building? A dApp or a Wallet?

- If you're building a Wallet, our Web3Auth Plug and Play SDKs can provide a quick and effective solution, although a better user experience for a
  wallet might come from our Core Kit SDKs, where Web3Auth is hidden. You just need put in additional engineering efforts to build the UX flows. You
  can switch between any of our SDKs in the future, however, it is important to consider you're choosing the right configuration for the future
  migration to be easier.

- If you're building a dApp any of our products can be useful, however, with Web3Auth PnP or Core Kit Solutions, you would need to manage the UX Flows
  and Interoperability yourself. Plug and Play can be quite useful as it contains some pre made flows to make the integration easier. Torus Wallet is
  a great integration too, but it is an independent wallet, so any of the UX flows will not be in your control.

### What chain are you building on?

- The good news is that Web3Auth is chain agnostic. That means you can build on any chain you prefer. We support `SECP256K1` and `ED25519` keys curves
  out of the box, and with private key manipulation, one can connect any chain. There are specialized providers for EVM, Solana and XRPL.
- Torus Wallet is currently only available for [EVM](https://app.tor.us), [Solana](https://solana.tor.us) and [XRPL](https://xrpl.tor.us).

### What platform are you using?

- Plug and Play SDKs support Web, Mobile (Android and iOS), Hybrid (React Native and Flutter) and Gaming (Unity and Unreal) environments.
- Core Kit SDKs support Web, Mobile (Android and iOS), and React Native environments.
- Torus Wallet is currently only available for Web.

### What level of interoperability do you need?

- For a fully interoperable flow, use the Torus wallet in your application. If interoperability is a plus but not a must, the WalletConnect
  interoperability that comes with all of our SDKs will work perfectly.

## UI/ UX Questions

### Do you require a prebuilt UI/UX for Login/MFA?

- If you want a ready-made solution, use our Web3Auth Plug and Play SDKs.
- If you prefer to craft your own UI/UX for your users, the Web3Auth Core-Kit SDKs are the way to go.
- Torus Wallet offers a more user-controlled approach, where the access of the wallet goes out of our app's scope. This is because it is an
  independent wallet itself using Web3Auth authentication. This may or may not be desirable depending on your user base.

### Do you need auto-signing?

- By auto-signing, we mean that the UX for approving the transaction is controlled by the application itself. This can only be done when the
  application has access to the private key/ user signature.
- Both Plug and Play SDKs and Core-Kit SDKs feature auto signing, removing the need for your users to approve each transaction.
- Torus Wallet offers a more user-controlled approach, allowing users to view transaction details, which may or may not be desirable depending on your
  user base.

## Infrastructure Questions

### Do you want to manage the MFA Infrastructure?

- If you'd like to maintain ownership of the MFA Infrastructure, our Core-Kit SDKs are the best choice for you.

### Do you want to manage the Login Infrastructure ie. use any existing Social Logins (e.g. Google, FB, etc…) , or a passwordless login of your own?

- Both our Plug and Play and Core Kit SDKs allow you to manage your own Login Infrastructure. It is a feature called Custom Authentication in Plug and
  Play SDKs and a requirement for Core Kit SDKs.

### Do you want to customize the storage and threshold of the user key shares?

- The Web3Auth Plug and Play SDK gives you the standard way of storing the user key shares. If you want to customise the storage of the user key
  shares, you can use our Core Kit SDKs.
- With Core Kit SDKs, you can customize the threshold and the number of shares required to recover the user key. You can also customise the storage of
  the user key shares. From Devices share storage to Social Recovery, QR backups, Email Backups, Database encrypted storage etc. you can choose the
  flow you want to use.

## SSS vs MPC Questions

### Do you want the user key to be present in the application frontend?

- If you're looking to keep the user key in the frontend, our traditional SDKs, powered by Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme, can be a good choice for
  you.
- If you prefer to keep the user's keys divided the whole time and only have a temporary sign generated when the user is signing, our new SDKs,
  powered by the Threshold Signature Scheme, are the way to go.

### Do you want to import keys from other wallets?

- If you want to import keys from other wallets, you can use our Core Kit SDKs.
- The Core Kit SDKs have the option of key import, however, it has the trade off of key generation integrity. This is because to maintain non
  custodiality, we make sure that key imported is encrypted by the Web3Auth generated key, and stored on the metadata server. It is not possible to
  directly import a key and distribute into multiple parts within the Shamir Secret Sharing infrastructure.
- The best place to import keys can be the MPC Infrastructure. With the import key API in our MPC SDKs, it is possible to import upto 4 keys directly
  into the MPC infrastructure. However, as you import multiple keys, the user interaction tends to become slower.

### Do you want your user to be able export their key?

- If you want your users to be able to export their key, you can any of our SDKs.
- With SSS based SDKs, the key is reconstructed on every login, so the user can export the key at any point of time.
- With MPC based SDKs, the key reconstruction never happens, hence the process of exporting the key is a bit more complex. Exports can be done via an
  opensource external script that can be locally run. Alternatively we’re in the midst of developing a simple binary which could be operated to
  combine the factors.
