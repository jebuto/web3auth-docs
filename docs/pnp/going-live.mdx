Before going live with Web3Auth Plug and Play SDKs, please make sure you have completed the following steps:

### 1. Create a Web3Auth Production Client ID

Make sure your client id for Web3Auth is on the Sapphire Mainnet Network. The Sapphire Mainnet is our geo-distributed, horizontally scalable network.
If you have certain specific requirements for the network configurations for scalability, please reach out to us at our
[Community Portal](https://community.web3auth.io).

:::info

You need to create a Sapphire Devnet client id for the same name before creating a production client id. This is to ensure that your testing and
production environments are separate and the wallets generated for the end users remain safe.

:::

:::warning

Make sure your Web3Auth Network in the SDK initialization is the **same** as your client id network, otherwise you find see errors while logging your
users in.

:::

### 2. Create a Web3Auth Production Verifier

While using the [Custom Authentication Feature](/pnp/features/custom-authentication) in the Plug and Play SDKs, you will need to create a verifier.
Make sure the network of the verifier is the same as the network of the client id.

:::warning

All new verifiers produce **different wallets/ accounts** for users, it is not possible to rename a verifier once you have created it. The person who
has created the verifier can only edit it afterwards. This is a limitation even when you have a team setup. This is because a verifier is a smart
contract and the address editing it cannot be changed. The only way to change this is to create a new verifier.

:::

### 3. Update your Web3Auth SDKs to the latest version

We are constantly updating our SDKs to make sure they are secure and performant. Make sure you are using the latest version of the SDKs. Please do not
actively use the pre release versions, rather wait for the latest stable release.

### 4. Use a production RPC Endpoint for your respective blockchains

For testing purposes, our examples and SDKs use public RPC endpoints. Make sure you are using a production RPC endpoint (by providers like Infura,
Quicknode, Alchemy etc.) for your production environment before going live. This can be done by updating the
[`rpcTarget`](/sdk/pnp/web/modal/initialize#chainconfig) value in the `Web3Auth` object in the SDK initialisation in Web SDKs and updating the
provider URL in mobile SDKs.

### 5. Audit the UX for your Web3Auth Login flow

From the icon showing up in the Web3Auth Modal to the [whitelabel setting](/pnp/features/whitelabel/) for the intermediary pages that are shown to the
user, make sure you have checked your branding and customisations. Checking all the possible flows is recommended.

### 6. Check your interoperability flow

If you're using [interoperability with Torus Wallet](/pnp/features/interoperability#using-web3auth-dashboard-toggles) on the dashboard settings, you
need to use Web3Auth in the `mainnet` network. It is recommended that you audit that flow before going live. Your app name shown in the Torus Wallet
login screen is the app name of your Client Id so make sure you have updated that.

If you're using [WalletConnect or Web3Auth Plugins based interoperability flow](/pnp/features/interoperability#interoperability-with-plugins), make
sure you have tested the flow before going live.

### 7. Check in multiple browsers and devices

The Web3Auth SDKs are built to work in all [major browsers and devices](/troubleshooting/supported-browsers). Make sure you have tested your login
flow in all major browsers and devices. If you're facing any issues with any particular browser or device, please make sure they're compatible with
the Web3Auth SDKs.

### 8. Upgrade your Web3Auth Plan

Finally, make sure you're on the correct [Web3Auth Plan](https://web3auth.io/pricing.html) according to the features you're looking to use in the
production environment. Additionally make sure to add a credit card in the Web3Auth Dashboard so that your services are not stopped once the MAW cap
has reached.
